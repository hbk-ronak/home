This file contains all the tickets required to implement the homepage UI described in the design doc. These tickets are designed for a junior frontend engineer (~2 years of experience). As the tech lead, I've added detailed context, design goals, and clear deliverables for each.

---

## ✅ Ticket 1: Project Setup (HTML, CSS, JS) - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Set up the basic structure of the project for GitHub Pages.

**Tasks:**

* Create the following files:

  * `index.html` ✅
  * `style.css` ✅
  * `script.js` ✅
* Include [Tailwind CSS via CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn). ✅
* Link the CSS and JS files in `index.html`. ✅
* Add HTML boilerplate with `lang="en"`, viewport meta tag, and dark background color using Tailwind (`bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-100`). ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Opening `index.html` shows a black screen with white text: "Hello World" styled by Tailwind. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used custom Tailwind config with dark theme colors (`dark-bg: #222222`, `card-bg: #333333`)
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design with `max-w-md mx-auto px-6`
- Added proper semantic HTML structure with accessibility considerations
- Included custom CSS for enhanced checkbox styling and scrollbars

**Notes:**

* This project will be deployed on GitHub Pages — no backend.

---

## ✅ Ticket 2: Clock Widget - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Add a live digital clock at the top center of the homepage.

**Tasks:**

* In `index.html`, create a container for the clock (e.g., `<div id="clock">`). ✅
* Style it with Tailwind: `text-3xl`, `font-mono`, `text-center`, `mt-4`. ✅
* In `script.js`, use `setInterval` to update the time every second in 24-hour format (HH\:MM\:SS). ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Clock is visible and updates every second. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Clock updates every second using `setInterval(updateClock, 1000)`
- Styled with `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-mono font-light text-center text-gray-300`

# 🐍 Design Document: Snake Game Widget for Static Homepage

## 📌 Objective

Add a simple, classic Snake game to the personal homepage that:

* Works seamlessly on both **mobile** and **desktop**
* Includes **touchscreen directional controls** for phones
* Uses **keyboard arrows** for desktops/laptops
* Respects the minimalist dark-mode aesthetic
* Sets a consistent structure for future games (Tic-Tac-Toe, 2048, etc.)

## 🧱 Architecture and Widget Pattern

Each game should follow a consistent modular widget structure:

```html
<section class="game-widget" id="snake-game-widget">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold">🎮 Snake</h2>
  <div class="snake-container">
    <!-- canvas or grid for snake -->
  </div>
  <div class="controls">
    <!-- arrow buttons for mobile -->
  </div>
  <p id="snake-score">Score: 0</p>
  <button id="snake-restart">Restart</button>
</section>
```

Game logic should be isolated in its own JS module (e.g. `snake.js`) to allow clean integration and future extensions.

---

## 🎮 Game Design

### 📏 Game Area

* Rendered as a grid or HTML `<canvas>` (20x20 cells by default)
* Snake grows with each food eaten
* Game over when it hits the wall or itself

### ⌨️ Controls

* **Desktop:** Arrow keys (`keydown` listener)
* **Mobile:** On-screen arrow buttons

  ```html
  <div class="mobile-controls">
    <button data-dir="up">⬆</button>
    <button data-dir="left">⬅</button>
    <button data-dir="down">⬇</button>
    <button data-dir="right">➡</button>
  </div>
  ```

### 📈 Score Tracking

* Displayed below the game area
* High score stored in `localStorage`

### 🔁 Restart

* Reset the snake, score, and food without refreshing the page

---

## 🎨 Styling

* **Dark theme:** use Tailwind (`bg-gray-800`, `border-gray-600`, `text-white`)
* **Grid:** fixed aspect ratio; max width for mobile
* **Controls:** large tap targets (44px min)

---

## 📦 Future-Proofing for More Games

All games should:

* Live in their own `<section class="game-widget">`
* Use dedicated JS modules (e.g. `ticTacToe.js`, `memoryGame.js`)
* Use consistent class names and container IDs
* Support a standard init function: `initGame(containerEl)`

Optionally, add a collapsible **"Games" section** to house all game widgets in the future.

---

## ✅ Deliverables

* Self-contained Snake widget with:

  * Grid display
  * Food generation
  * Keyboard + touch controls
  * Score + high score
  * Restart button
* Game logic in `snake.js`
* Hook from main `script.js` to initialize the game
