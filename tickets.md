This file contains all the tickets required to implement the homepage UI described in the design doc. These tickets are designed for a junior frontend engineer (~2 years of experience). As the tech lead, I've added detailed context, design goals, and clear deliverables for each.

---

## ✅ Ticket 1: Project Setup (HTML, CSS, JS) - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Set up the basic structure of the project for GitHub Pages.

**Tasks:**

* Create the following files:

  * `index.html` ✅
  * `style.css` ✅
  * `script.js` ✅
* Include [Tailwind CSS via CDN](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/play-cdn). ✅
* Link the CSS and JS files in `index.html`. ✅
* Add HTML boilerplate with `lang="en"`, viewport meta tag, and dark background color using Tailwind (`bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-100`). ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Opening `index.html` shows a black screen with white text: "Hello World" styled by Tailwind. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Used custom Tailwind config with dark theme colors (`dark-bg: #222222`, `card-bg: #333333`)
- Implemented mobile-first responsive design with `max-w-md mx-auto px-6`
- Added proper semantic HTML structure with accessibility considerations
- Included custom CSS for enhanced checkbox styling and scrollbars

**Notes:**

* This project will be deployed on GitHub Pages — no backend.

## ✅ Ticket 2: Clock Widget - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Add a live digital clock at the top center of the homepage.

**Tasks:**

* In `index.html`, create a container for the clock (e.g., `<div id="clock">`). ✅
* Style it with Tailwind: `text-3xl`, `font-mono`, `text-center`, `mt-4`. ✅
* In `script.js`, use `setInterval` to update the time every second in 24-hour format (HH\:MM\:SS). ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Clock is visible and updates every second. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Clock updates every second using `setInterval(updateClock, 1000)`
- Styled with `text-4xl md:text-5xl font-mono font-light text-center text-gray-300`
- Positioned prominently at the top with proper spacing

**Notes:**

* Use `toLocaleTimeString('en-GB')` for 24-hour time. ✅

---

## ✅ Ticket 3: Search Box with Configurable Engine - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Implement a search input with a dropdown to select the search engine.

**Tasks:**

* Add a `<form>` with:

  * Text input for query ✅
  * Select dropdown with engines: Google, DuckDuckGo, Startpage ✅
  * Submit button ✅
* On submit, redirect to the selected engine with the query string. ✅
* Store the selected engine in `localStorage` and restore it on page load. ✅

**Acceptance Criteria:**

* Typing a query and selecting a search engine redirects correctly. ✅
* The selected engine remains remembered between page loads. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Search form includes magnifying glass icon and proper input styling
- Engine preference is saved to localStorage and restored on page load
- Form validation prevents empty searches
- Responsive layout with dropdown and button side-by-side

**Notes:**

* Use Tailwind to make the form responsive and styled. ✅
* Make sure to `preventDefault()` on form submit and use `window.location.href` manually. ✅

## ✅ Ticket 4: YouTube Music Player (External Redirect) - COMPLETED

**Goal:** Add a button that redirects the user to a YouTube Music playlist.

* Clicking the button opens the YouTube Music playlist in a new tab and starts playback. ✅

**Implementation Notes:**
- Created card-style widget with YouTube Music branding
- Button opens playlist in new tab using `window.open()`
- **TODO**: Replace `PLAYLIST_ID` placeholder with actual playlist ID
- Styled with red accent color to match YouTube branding

**Notes:**

* Replace `<YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID>` with the actual playlist ID. ⚠️ TODO
* Use `window.open(url, '_blank')` or `window.location.href` depending on desired behavior (new tab or same tab). ✅
* YouTube Music supports autoplay via `&play=1`, but autoplay behavior may still depend on browser policy. ✅
* No iframe or embedded player is needed. ✅
